# Mars

* Orbit duration of Mars?
    * Orbit of ~687 Earth days.
* Size of Mars?
    * Surface area of 0.28 Earths, volume of ~0.15 Earths, and mass of ~0.1 Earths.
* Mars tectonic activity?
    * Geologically and tectonically inactive.
* Most likely non-Earth planet in solar system to find life?
    * Mars. Most likely to harbor liquid, and thus find life.
* Objects that surpass Mars in brightness?
    * Only Jupiter and Venus (and the Moon).
* Mars moons?
    * Two moons, Phobos and Deimos, which are small and irregularly shaped, and may be captured asteroids.
* Cause of Mars red coloration?
    * Described as the "Red Planet", as the iron oxide prevalent on its surface gives it a reddish appearance.
* Mars rotational period?
    * Similar rotational period and seasonal cycles to those of Earth (similar axial tilt to Earth's gives it seasons).
* Mars largest basin?
    * Smooth Borealis basin in the northern hemisphere covers 40% of the planet and its relatively low crater count indicates that it may be a giant impact feature.
* Mars ice?
    * In 2005, radar data revealed the presence of large quantities of water ice at the poles and at mid-latitudes, the _Phoenix_ lander sampled water ice in 2008.
* Mars landed spacecraft?
    * Current hosts three functional orbiting spacecraft: _Mars Odyssey_, _Mars Express_, and the _Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter_. Rovers _Spirit_ and _Opportunity_ are on the surface, as well as other inert landers and rovers.
* Atmosphere characteristics of Mars?
    * Thin atmosphere, less than 1% of Earth's surface pressure. Surface temperature ranges from -87C during polar winters, to -5C in summers.
